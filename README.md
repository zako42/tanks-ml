# tanks-ml

This is a project / tutorial I'm building which integrates the Unity Tanks!
tutorial with Unity ML Agents.
Also plays with Unity Image Synthesis repo to see if adding some of those CV
tools helps with training.

The purpose is to play around with and learn some of the different ML Agents features.

## directory structure

Requires Unity ML Agents.

I nested all this stuff under the Unity ML Agents directory structure
Assets/Demonstrations since it's ignored in the ML Agents repo.
This is just to make it easier to upgrade ML Agents,
so we don't need to worry about merge conflicts or whatnot.
